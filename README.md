## Getting Neo Vim to run correctly

You're going to need to get Packer Added, so that you can compile your plugins before `nvim` command will work properly.

Follow the [QuickStart| https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim#quickstart] on the Packer README.

Afterwards open NeoVim and run the following commands:
PackerCompile
PackerUpdate
